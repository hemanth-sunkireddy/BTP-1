00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,580
Hi everyone, welcome to the class.

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,130
This video will talk about introduction to machine learning.

3
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:17,879
So before we talk about machine learning, let's talk about a several buzz word here.

4
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:24,489
You might have heard about data science, which some of you might be taking other courses in data science.

5
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:30,719
Surely you heard about machine learning because this course is going to be about machine learning.

6
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:40,000
Many of you might have heard about artificial intelligence, which is another buzzword, along with the machine learning and data science these days.

7
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,340
Maybe you also heard about deep learning, which is another hype word.

8
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,159
So let's briefly talk about what these are.

9
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:53,379
So for data science, it's a really big interdisciplinary field about data.

10
00:00:53,679 --> 00:01:03,560
So you can think about it's actually anything to do with data, including data pipelining, even data collection and data munging and cleaning and data analysis.

11
00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:16,069
which may include manual data analysis, including some simple checks or exploratory data analysis, or can also include machine learning techniques to analyze the data.

12
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:22,750
Since the data science has a really big spectrum, it can oftentimes be called soft and hard data science.

13
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:30,449
Soft data science means dealing with the techniques that doesn't require a lot of software engineering skills or a lot of math skills.

14
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:40,229
So something like data visualization and reporting, dashboard, those kind of things, as well as simple data analysis, can fall into that category.

15
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:51,450
Whereas the hard data science, those involve more mathematical and more technical skills, such as analyzing data or building systems using machine learning.

16
00:01:52,840 --> 00:02:03,479
Also, data science can deal with the data that's a small size that can fit into your Excel file or something like that, or it's a big data that sits in the big data warehouse.

17
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:08,789
In industry, the job description looks like this.

18
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:12,500
So the data scientists, their job role can be varied.

19
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:19,000
They can do data collection, cleaning, and managing data or preparing data for whatever the company needs.

20
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,189
or they can build machine learning models and do the testing on those data or build a system.

21
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,090
As well as they can also do the visualization and stuff.

22
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:35,590
So usually data scientists have diverse backgrounds and they require interdisciplinary knowledge.

23
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:42,409
Machine learning, we mentioned that machine learning several times during the talk about data science.

24
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:48,879
So machine learning is part of data science and it is also a subfield of artificial intelligence.

25
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,140
It focuses on learning algorithms and building models and training them on the data.

26
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:02,489
Machine learning consists of different types of learning, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, or reinforcement learning.

27
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:06,799
Many machine learning models, they are coming from statistical learning.

28
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:17,589
So machine learning extends the statistical learning by including more complex algorithms, which deal with more complex data and bigger data, and more efficient algorithms.

29
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,889
In industry, machine learning engineers can develop and test machine learning models and design machine learning experiments.

30
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,830
and build machine learning systems.

31
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:35,400
Artificial intelligence has a long history in the CS, and it is about problem solving with intelligence.

32
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:45,360
That means an AI agent will make an optimal decision according to its algorithm, whether it has a learning component or not, to maximize the goal as a response to the environment.

33
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:52,909
You might think that AI field is very practical because you're seeing a lot of applications these days.

34
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,569
However, AI also has a lot of theoretical components in it.

35
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:09,909
And in industry, AI engineers and experts, they are more or less similar to ML engineers, but in broad set skills, including math and programming skills, as well as machine learning.

36
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:18,209
And they work on building AI system, building machine learning models, natural language processing, robotics, and computer vision and stuff.

37
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:26,089
And deep learning focuses on neural network models, so building neural network models and training them on data.

38
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:35,019
And it also deals with a lot of optimization algorithms and training techniques in order to deal with the complex neural network model training.

39
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:43,900
It is very suitable for complex data such as images, texts and voice, and graphs, and hybrid types of data.

40
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,770
It is a subfield of artificial intelligence and subfield of machine learning.

41
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:53,660
And in industry, deep learning engineers work on machine learning problems.

42
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:59,760
It deals with complex data such as images and texts and things like that, or even high performance computing.

43
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,110
We're going to show some summary diagram.

44
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,990
So there is a data science, which is a big interdisciplinary field.

45
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,910
And there is AI, also very big field.

46
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,550
Data science is about anything to do with data, including data analysis.

47
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:19,490
Whereas artificial intelligence is about solving problems using intelligent algorithms.

48
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:26,430
And in intersection, when the AI algorithm is learning from the data, it is called machine learning.

49
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:33,500
And particularly, if it deals with complex data with neural network architecture, it is called deep learning.

50
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:41,000
And here is the Google trend on the term on machine learning and software engineering.

51
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:46,320
Just to compare how the machine learning becomes popular for recent few years.

52
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:55,210
The term machine learning has been around for a long time, however, it became much more popular during the last five or more years.

53
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:06,550
This graph also indicates that the job growth in machine learning has grown up really much, about 350% during the past few years.

54
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,370
As you can see, machine learning is a top skill in the jobs that involves AI skills.

55
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,820
Alright, that already sounds like ML is very cool.

56
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,130
Let's talk about what ML can do.

57
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,620
So, machine learning is applied everywhere these days.

58
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:30,480
So, for example, when you do online shopping, you often see this product recommendation based on your browsing and shopping history.

59
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:37,380
And those use machine learning algorithms to predict the products that are more likely to be purchased by the customers.

60
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,120
Same goes for movie recommendation and music recommendations.

61
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:47,060
So sentiment analysis is very popular applications these days.

62
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:54,550
It is standard by now that data scientists analyze the texts such as news articles and social media articles.

63
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,970
to figure out citizens' sentiment on political events.

64
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:07,689
Similarly, the product review scales or restaurant review scales can be predicted by machine learning algorithms, which information can be important for businesses.

65
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,490
Machine learning is also used a lot in the financial industry.

66
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,400
So, for example, we can forecast the stock price using machine learning.

67
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:27,360
Machine learning is also used for algorithmic trading, as well as RoboAdvisor, which gives advice for people on how to allocate their assets.

68
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:31,300
Also, it can be used for forecasting housing price.

69
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,790
And as you can imagine, machine learning can be also useful in medical industry.

70
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:46,080
By applying machine learning models in the images or tables, it can help doctors to make a medical diagnosis or medical decisions.

71
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:51,440
It is also used in many science disciplines, such as the bioscience.

72
00:07:51,690 --> 00:08:02,060
So for example, machine learning techniques can be applied to this graph data to inspect the protein interactions or this type of data for the study of genetics.

73
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,610
Machine learning is also a key component in Internet of Things.

74
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:16,160
Smart sensors and smart devices produce a lot of data, and also machine learning plays a key role in analyzing those data.

75
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,690
Machine learning is also used in self-driving cars.

76
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:25,710
Self-driving cars can use machine learning and deep learning to recognize images and make decisions.

77
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:30,800
Alright, so let's talk about what we will learn in this course.

78
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,850
So here is the data science project lifecycle.

79
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:39,430
So data should be collected and pipelined into data warehouse.

80
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:43,900
And there is a data governance that the data warehouse has to implement.

81
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:50,450
And there will be also data pulling and cleaning and maintaining the data.

82
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,610
And that part is called data engineering mostly.

83
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:03,650
Data science, on the other hand, focuses on using the data and analyzing those data that were prepared by the data engineering process.

84
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:15,720
So you can include the selection of those data from the warehouse and then cleaning those data and exploratory data analysis and data pre-processing, which means that we prepare data for the model to consume.

85
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:22,240
And after that, data scientists will build the models and then do the model training.

86
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:23,600
And there is a result.

87
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,990
And depending on the result, they have to go back to build models.

88
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:33,420
Or if the result is so strange, then they will have to collect more data or select more data and do this cycle again.

89
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:35,080
All right.

90
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:41,460
So among the steps that we mentioned in the data science project cycle, we're going to talk about a few things.

91
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,470
And we don't cover everything.

92
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,610
So, for example, this course is not about data collection and pipelining.

93
00:09:48,560 --> 00:10:01,830
We'll talk about a little bit of data cleaning and EDA and data pre-processing but the main focus will be how to build a model, how to select models and how to do the training and do the testing and analyze those results.

94
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:05,100
Okay so let's talk about what is learning.

95
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,930
When these children learn alphabets they can learn to generalize.

96
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:18,720
So for example they can recognize this letter whether it's a small or large or it has a different font or it has a different color

97
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,350
or the image looks angled, or the letter is in the word.

98
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,760
It seems so obvious for people, however, to make a machine to learn this, it is not trivial.

99
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,910
So here is some example of supervised learning.

100
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,560
There are images and the labels.

101
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,160
The labels are the names of these animals.

102
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,320
And a supervised learning model learns to predict the label given data.

103
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,610
Unsupervised learning actually resembles very much how humans learn.

104
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:55,790
So in baby stage, they don't know about the geometric shapes and colors.

105
00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:09,970
But over time, they learn to recognize these visual properties and also recognize the similarities and dissimilarities between them, even before they learn about the names of these colors and shapes.

106
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,920
So those types of learning without labels are called unsupervised learning.

107
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:25,460
And unsupervised learning is about learning underlying features and extracting information, organizing patterns in the data, or clustering similar data points.

108
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:29,610
Another type of learning is reinforcement learning.

109
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,790
which the AI agent learns how to act from experience.

110
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,810
So experience is either reward or punishment.

111
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,379
It is very much similar to the animal training.

112
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:45,960
So we give treats or punishment to make the animal behave desired way.

113
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,710
So reinforcement learning is used a lot in AI and robotics.

114
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:58,290
All right, so let's change gears and then talk about some definitions that frequently show up in machine learning.

115
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:02,340
So data in machine learning can be any forms such as tables,

116
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,130
images and text and sounds and graphs.

117
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,630
It can be any format.

118
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:10,700
However, we're going to talk about mostly the tabulated data format.

119
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,920
So let's take an example of this table.

120
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,190
Let's say the supervised learning task is to predict the house price.

121
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,870
So this one would be our labels.

122
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:27,310
And these labels also are called targets.

123
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,770
And all these columns, except the labels, they are called the features.

124
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:47,710
And also they are called predictors, which means that those features and predictors are used in the machine learning models to predict the labels.

125
00:12:49,830 --> 00:13:01,400
And this row of the tables are called observations, or samples, which means that the instances of data.

126
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,670
Here are some few examples of machine learning tasks.

127
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:12,509
So for example, prediction includes classification regression, and these are in supervised learning.

128
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:23,680
And clustering, which groups the similar data points together, and anomaly detection and dimensionality reduction, they are in a category of unsupervised learning.

129
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:34,870
And there are other machine learning tasks, such as data generation and feature selection, which are typically not categorized as supervised learning or unsupervised learning.

130
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:41,430
However, these type of machine learning tasks can be used to enhance the performance of supervised learning tasks.

131
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,759
Alright, so let's talk about prediction tasks in supervised learning.

132
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:53,059
Prediction tasks can be either classification or regression, depending on the label's data type.

133
00:13:54,289 --> 00:14:07,350
So, when the label is a categorical variable, which means 0 or 1, or 1, 2, 3, or a, b, c, these are called categorical variables, and in that case, it becomes classification.

134
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,639
If the categories are binary, it is called binary class classification.

135
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:16,040
And if it's multi-categories, call them multi-class classification.

136
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,320
Binary, multi-class.

137
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:34,690
On the other hand, if the label variable is a real value variable, so something like 0.1, 0.999, something like that, or 3.4.

138
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:43,430
So real value variables, to predict those labels given the data, is called a regression problem.

139
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,070
So with that in mind, let's talk about how supervised learning works briefly.

140
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,670
So here's the data.

141
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,800
Data consists of features and target.

142
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:01,160
So feature usually we call x and target is y.

143
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:06,530
And then we have a model and this feature is input to the model.

144
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,120
The model might have parameters inside or hyperparameters.

145
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,720
That means some settings the user get to choose.

146
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:19,379
And then after feeding the features into model, the model will make a prediction.

147
00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:26,669
Initially, the model doesn't predict very well, so there will be some error between the prediction and target variable.

148
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:36,240
And this error can be used to tweak the model to have a better prediction next iteration, and over this iteration, the model becomes more accurate.

149
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:39,029
So that's how supervised learning works.

150
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,639
So here is a brief taxonomy of supervised learning models.

151
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:49,159
So for models that has internal parameters, it is called parametric models.

152
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:54,649
We are explaining what those are individually, and these are examples of parametric models.
