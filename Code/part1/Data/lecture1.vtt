Hi everyone, welcome
to the class.

2
00:00:07.935 --> 00:00:09.555
This video will talk about

3
00:00:09.555 --> 00:00:12.160
introduction to
machine learning.

4
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.555
Before we talk about
machine learning,

5
00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:18.285
Let's talk about a
separate password here.

6
00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:20.715
Or you might have heard
about data science,

7
00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:22.365
which some of you might be

8
00:00:22.365 --> 00:00:25.140
taking other courses
in data science.

9
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.795
Surely you heard about
machine learning

10
00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:29.295
because this course is

11
00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:31.350
going to be about
machine learning.

12
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.150
Many of you might have

13
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.595
heard about artificial
intelligence,

14
00:00:35.595 --> 00:00:37.860
which is another
buzzword along with

15
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.495
the machine learning and
data science these days.

16
00:00:40.495 --> 00:00:42.845
Maybe you also heard
about deep learning,

17
00:00:42.845 --> 00:00:44.860
which is another height world.

18
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.610
Let's briefly talk
about what these are.

19
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.500
For data science.

20
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.630
It's really big interdisciplinary
field about data.

21
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.190
You can think about it's

22
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.870
actually anything
to do with data,

23
00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.105
including Data Pipelining,

24
00:00:59.105 --> 00:01:00.905
even Data Collection and

25
00:01:00.905 --> 00:01:03.770
Data Munging and cleaning
and Data Analysis,

26
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.725
which may include the
manual data analysis,

27
00:01:06.725 --> 00:01:08.585
including some simple checks

28
00:01:08.585 --> 00:01:11.405
or exploratory data analysis.

29
00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:13.760
Or can also include

30
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.505
the machine learning techniques
to analyze the data.

31
00:01:16.505 --> 00:01:19.055
Since the data science that
has a really big spectrum,

32
00:01:19.055 --> 00:01:22.970
it can oftentimes called the
soft and hard data science.

33
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.785
Soft data science means

34
00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:26.630
dealing with the
techniques that doesn't

35
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.655
require a lot of software
engineering skills

36
00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:30.955
are a lot of math skills.

37
00:01:30.955 --> 00:01:33.140
Something like data
visualization and

38
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.125
reporting, dashboard,
those thing.

39
00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:38.510
As well as simple Data Analysis,

40
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.475
can fall into the category

41
00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:42.680
of where's the
hard data science.

42
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.945
Those involve more mathematical

43
00:01:44.945 --> 00:01:47.135
and more technical skills,

44
00:01:47.135 --> 00:01:48.875
such as analyzing data

45
00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:52.130
or building systems
using machine learning.

46
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.400
Also, data science can
deal with the data that's

47
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.050
a small size that can fit into

48
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.465
your Excel file or
something like that.

49
00:01:59.465 --> 00:02:04.500
Or it's a big data that sits
in the Big Data Warehouse.

50
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.260
In industry, the job
description looks like this.

51
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.815
The data scientist's the
job role can be very,

52
00:02:12.815 --> 00:02:14.480
they can do data collection,

53
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.400
cleaning and munging
data are preparing

54
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.295
data for whatever
the company needs.

55
00:02:19.295 --> 00:02:21.530
Or they can build machine
learning models and

56
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.600
do the testing on
those data would build

57
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.520
a system as well

58
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.400
as they can also do the
visualization and stuff.

59
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.510
Usually data scientists
have diverse backgrounds

60
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.160
and they require

61
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.645
interdisciplinary knowledge.
Machine learning.

62
00:02:38.645 --> 00:02:41.030
You mentioned the machine
learning several times

63
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.580
during the talk
about data science.

64
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.250
Machine learning is part
of data science and it

65
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.385
is also a sub field of
artificial intelligence.

66
00:02:49.385 --> 00:02:51.710
It focuses on learning
algorithm and

67
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.725
building models and
training them on the data.

68
00:02:54.725 --> 00:02:57.800
Machine learning consists of
different types of loading,

69
00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.495
such as supervised learning,

70
00:02:59.495 --> 00:03:03.025
unsupervised learning, or
reinforcement learning.

71
00:03:03.025 --> 00:03:04.925
Many machine learning models,

72
00:03:04.925 --> 00:03:07.250
they are coming from
statistical learning.

73
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.115
Machine learning extends
the statistical learning

74
00:03:10.115 --> 00:03:12.845
by including more
complex algorithm,

75
00:03:12.845 --> 00:03:14.990
which deal with more
complex data and

76
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.950
bigger data and more
efficient algorithms.

77
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.820
Any industry machine learning

78
00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.680
engineers can develop and test

79
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.210
the machine learning models and

80
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.070
design machine
learning experiments

81
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.775
and build machine
learning systems.

82
00:03:27.775 --> 00:03:29.985
Artificial intelligence.

83
00:03:29.985 --> 00:03:32.105
It has a long
history in the CNS,

84
00:03:32.105 --> 00:03:35.590
and it is about problem-solving
with the intelligence.

85
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.400
That means an AI agent will make

86
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.085
an optimal decision
according to its algorithm.

87
00:03:40.085 --> 00:03:42.545
Whether it has a learning
component or not,

88
00:03:42.545 --> 00:03:46.075
to maximize the goal as a
response to the environment.

89
00:03:46.075 --> 00:03:49.055
You might think that I
feel this very practical

90
00:03:49.055 --> 00:03:53.120
because you're seeing a lot
of applications these days.

91
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.725
However, AI also has

92
00:03:54.725 --> 00:03:57.630
a lot of theoretical
components in it.

Industry AI engineers
and experts.

94
00:04:01.425 --> 00:04:04.565
They are more or less
similar to ML engineers.

95
00:04:04.565 --> 00:04:07.430
But in broad sets
skills including

96
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.920
mass and programming skills
as well as machine-learning.

97
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.815
They work on building AI system,

98
00:04:12.815 --> 00:04:14.705
building machine learning models

99
00:04:14.705 --> 00:04:16.205
that drilling the processing,

100
00:04:16.205 --> 00:04:18.860
robotics and computer
vision and stuff.

101
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.225
In deep learning focuses
on neural network models.

102
00:04:23.225 --> 00:04:26.660
Building neural network models
and training them on data.

103
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.655
It also tells us a lot of

104
00:04:28.655 --> 00:04:30.770
optimization algorithms
and training

105
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.750
techniques in order to deal

106
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.730
with a complex neural
network model training.

107
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.030
It is a very suitable for
complex data such as images,

108
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.325
texts and voice, and graphs,

109
00:04:42.325 --> 00:04:44.920
and hybrid types of data.

110
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.945
It is a subfield of

111
00:04:46.945 --> 00:04:49.810
artificial intelligence and
subfield of machine learning.

112
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.460

117
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.335
We're going to show
some summary diagram.

118
00:05:03.335 --> 00:05:05.080
There's a Data Science which is

119
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.225
a big interdisciplinary field,

120
00:05:07.225 --> 00:05:10.120
and there's AI also
very big field.

121
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.370
Data science is
about anything to do

122
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.770
with data, including
data analysis.

123
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.200
Whereas artificial
intelligence is about solving

124
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.885
problem using
intelligent algorithms.

125
00:05:19.885 --> 00:05:21.560
In intersection,

126
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.010
when the AI algorithm is
learning from the data,

127
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.235
it is called the
machine learning.

128
00:05:27.235 --> 00:05:29.720
Particularly if it tells you is

129
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.375
a complex data with a neural
network architecture,

130
00:05:32.375 --> 00:05:34.500
it is called deep learning.

131
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.260
Here is a Google trend on

132
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
the term on machine learning

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.180
Let's talk about what ML can do.

146
00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.830
Machine learning is applied
everywhere these days.

147
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.230
For example, when you
do online shopping,

148
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.390
you often see this
product recommendation

149
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.865
based on your browsing
and shopping history.

150
00:06:30.865 --> 00:06:32.935
Those use machine
learning algorithms

151
00:06:32.935 --> 00:06:34.240
to predict the products

152
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.660
that are more likely to be
purchased by the customers.

153
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.700
The same goes for
movie recommendation

154
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.080
and music recommendations.

155
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.270
Sentiment analysis is very

156
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.375
popular applications these days.

157
00:06:47.375 --> 00:06:48.895
It is standard by now,

158
00:06:48.895 --> 00:06:51.700
the data scientists
analyze the text,

159
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.260
such as news articles and

160
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.330
social media articles to figure

161
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.390
our citizens sentiment
on political events.

162
00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.940
Similarly, the product
review scales or

163
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.770
restaurant review scales can be

164
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.005
predicted by machine
learning algorithms,

165
00:07:05.005 --> 00:07:08.575
which information can be
important for businesses.

166
00:07:08.575 --> 00:07:10.840
Machine learning is also used

167
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.625
a lot in the financial industry.

168
00:07:12.625 --> 00:07:14.290
For example, we can

169
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.870
forecast the stock price
using machine learning.

170
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.680
Machine learning is also used
for algorithmic trading,

171
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.945
as well as robo-advisor,

172
00:07:22.945 --> 00:07:25.060
which gives advice for

173
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.835
people or how to
allocate their assets.

174
00:07:27.835 --> 00:07:32.170
Also, it can be used for
forecasting housing price.

175
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.870
As you can imagine,
machine learning can be

176
00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.360
also useful in medical industry.

177
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.430
By applying machine
learning models

178
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.485
in the images or tables,

179
00:07:41.485 --> 00:07:43.240
you can help doctors to make

180
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.765
a medical diagnosis
or medical decisions.

181
00:07:46.765 --> 00:07:50.095
It is also used in many
science disciplines,

182
00:07:50.095 --> 00:07:51.655
such as the bioscience.

183
00:07:51.655 --> 00:07:54.010
For example, machine
learning techniques can be

184
00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.560
applied to this graph
data to inspect

185
00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.445
the protein interactions or

186
00:07:59.445 --> 00:08:03.130
this type of data for
the study of genetics.

187
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:08.140
Machine learning is also key
component in other things.

188
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:12.220
Smart sensors and smart
devices produce a lot of data.

189
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.200
Also, machine learning plays

190
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.885
a key role on
analyzing those data.

191
00:08:16.885 --> 00:08:20.320
Machine learning is also
used in self-driving cars.

192
00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.140
Self-driving cars can
use machine learning and

193
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:27.620
deep learning to recognize
images and make decisions.

194
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:32.035
Let's talk about what we'll
learn in this course.

195
00:08:32.035 --> 00:08:35.605
Here is a data science
project life cycle.

196
00:08:35.605 --> 00:08:38.230
Data should be collected and

197
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:40.780
pipelined into data warehouse.

198
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.760
There's a data
governance that though

199
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.940
data warehouse it
has to implement.

200
00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.370
There will be also
data pooling and

201
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.340
cleaning and
maintaining the data.

202
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:55.435
That part is called data
engineering mostly.

203
00:08:55.435 --> 00:08:57.625
Data science, on the other hand,

204
00:08:57.625 --> 00:09:00.100
focuses on using the
data and analyzing

205
00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.600
those data that were

206
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.285
prepared by the data
engineering process.

207
00:09:04.285 --> 00:09:06.340
You can include the selection of

208
00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.800
the dose data from the
warehouse and then cleaning

209
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.530
those data and
exploratory data analysis

210
00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:13.090
and data preprocessing,

211
00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:14.830
which means that we prepare data

212
00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.795
for the model to consume.

213
00:09:16.795 --> 00:09:19.300
After that, data
scientists will build

214
00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.480
the models and then do
the model training.

215
00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.015
There is a result and
depending on the result,

216
00:09:25.015 --> 00:09:27.130
they had to go back
to build models.

217
00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:28.960
Or if the result is so strange,

218
00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.150
then they will have to
collect more data or select

219
00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:34.375
more data and do
this cycle again.

220
00:09:34.375 --> 00:09:37.120
Among the steps that
we mentioned in

221
00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.265
the data science project cycle,

222
00:09:39.265 --> 00:09:41.650
we're going to talk
about a few things

223
00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:44.710
and we don't cover
everything for example,

224
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:48.085
this course is not about data
collection and pipelining.

225
00:09:48.085 --> 00:09:50.770
We'll talk about a little
bit of data cleaning

226
00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:53.620
and EDA and data preprocessing.

227
00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.590
But the main focus will
be how to build a model,

228
00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:58.000
how to select models,

229
00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.800
and how to do the
training and do

230
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.265
the testing and
analyze those results.

231
00:10:03.265 --> 00:10:06.070
Let's talk about
what is learning?

232
00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:08.980
When these children
learn alphabets,

233
00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.915
they can learn to generalize.

234
00:10:10.915 --> 00:10:14.185
For example, they can
recognize this letter,

235
00:10:14.185 --> 00:10:16.075
whether it's a small or large.

236
00:10:16.075 --> 00:10:19.555
It has a different font or
it has a different color.

237
00:10:19.555 --> 00:10:21.475
Or the image it looks angled,

238
00:10:21.475 --> 00:10:24.245
or the letter is in the word.

239
00:10:24.245 --> 00:10:27.015
It seems so obvious for people,

240
00:10:27.015 --> 00:10:29.385
however, to make a
motion to learn this.

241
00:10:29.385 --> 00:10:31.810
It is not trivial.

242
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:36.390
Here's some example of
supervised learning.

243
00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:38.790
There are images and the labels.

244
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.550
The labels are the
names of these animals.

245
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.650
A supervised learning
model learns to

246
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:46.360
predict the label given data.

247
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.200
Unsupervised learning
actually resembles

248
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.880
very much how a human learn.

249
00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.190
In babies stage, they
don't know about

250
00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:58.090
the geometric shapes and
colors but overtime,

251
00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:01.360
they learn to recognize
this visual properties and

252
00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.145
also recognize the similarities

253
00:11:03.145 --> 00:11:05.005
and dissimilarities
between them,

254
00:11:05.005 --> 00:11:06.430
even before they learn about

255
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:09.070
the names of this
color and shapes.

256
00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:11.770
Those type of learning
without labels

257
00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:14.875
are called
unsupervised learning.

258
00:11:14.875 --> 00:11:17.845
Unsupervised learning
is all about learning

259
00:11:17.845 --> 00:11:20.965
underlying features and
extracting information,

260
00:11:20.965 --> 00:11:23.395
recognizing patterns
in the data,

261
00:11:23.395 --> 00:11:26.110
or clustering
similar data points.

262
00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:29.800
Another type of learning
is reinforcement learning,

263
00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.490
which the AI agent learns
how to act from experience.

264
00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:37.450
Experience is either
reward or punishment.

265
00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:41.035
It is very much similar
to the animal training.

266
00:11:41.035 --> 00:11:43.645
We give treats or punishment

267
00:11:43.645 --> 00:11:46.795
to make the animal
behave desired way.

268
00:11:46.795 --> 00:11:51.770
Reinforcement learning is used
a lot in AI and robotics.

269
00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:55.180
Let's change gears
and then talk about

270
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.800
some definitions that frequently

271
00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.795
show up in machine learning.

272
00:11:58.795 --> 00:12:01.240
Data in machine learning
can be any forms,

273
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.850
such as tables,
images and texts,

274
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:05.365
and sounds and graph.

275
00:12:05.365 --> 00:12:06.730
It can be any format.

276
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:08.440
However, we're
going to talk about

277
00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.320
mostly the tabulated
data format.

278
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.170
Let's take one example
of this table.

279
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.420
Let's say the unsupervised
learning task

280
00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.220
is to predict a house price.

281
00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:23.605
This one would be our labels.

282
00:12:23.605 --> 00:12:28.340
In this labels also
are called targets.

283
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:34.060
All this columns except the
labels are there called

284
00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:40.250
the features and also they
are called predictors.

285
00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.470
Which means that those
features and predictors are

286
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:45.820
used in the machine learning

287
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:48.740
models to predict the labels.

288
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:51.670
This row of the tables are

289
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:57.980
called observations or samples.

290
00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:02.275
Which means that they
are instances of data.

291
00:13:02.275 --> 00:13:04.600
Here are some few examples of

292
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.240
machine learning
tasks for example,

293
00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.225
prediction include the
classification regression,

294
00:13:10.225 --> 00:13:11.620
and these are in

295
00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:15.880
supervised learning and
clustering into groups,

296
00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.040
the similar data
points together and

297
00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.980
anomaly detection and
dimensionality reduction.

298
00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:24.490
They are in a category of
unsupervised learning.

299
00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.065
There are other emotional
learning tasks,

300
00:13:27.065 --> 00:13:30.705
such as data generation and
feature selection which are

301
00:13:30.705 --> 00:13:32.865
typically not categorized as

302
00:13:32.865 --> 00:13:34.875
supervised learning or
unsupervised learning.

303
00:13:34.875 --> 00:13:38.040
However, this type of
machine learning tasks can

304
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:42.430
be used to enhance the performance
of a supervised tasks.

305
00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:47.065
Let's talk about prediction
tasks in supervised learning.

306
00:13:47.065 --> 00:13:50.050
Prediction task can be
either classification or

307
00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:53.785
regression depending on
the labels datatype.

308
00:13:53.785 --> 00:13:57.010
When the label is
categorical variable,

309
00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:58.540
which means a zero or one,

310
00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:01.480
or 1,2,3 or A, B,

311
00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.570
C. These are called
categorical variables,

312
00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:07.915
and in that case, it
becomes classification.

313
00:14:07.915 --> 00:14:10.120
If the categories are binary,

314
00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.910
it is called the binary
class classification.

315
00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:14.995
If it's a multi categories

316
00:14:14.995 --> 00:14:17.755
call them multi-class
classification.

317
00:14:17.755 --> 00:14:25.705
Binary multiclass.
The other hand,

318
00:14:25.705 --> 00:14:29.650
if the label variable is
a real valued variable,

319
00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:32.575
so something like 0.1,

320
00:14:32.575 --> 00:14:38.950
0.999, something
like that, or 3.4.

321
00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:42.190
Real value variables to predict

322
00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:43.885
those labels given the data

323
00:14:43.885 --> 00:14:46.730
is called a regression problem.

324
00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.640
With that in mind,
let's talk about

325
00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.445
how supervised learning
works briefly.

326
00:14:54.445 --> 00:14:58.030
Here's the data. Data consists
of features and target.

327
00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:01.480
Feature usually we call
x and target is y.

328
00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.415
Then we have a model,

329
00:15:03.415 --> 00:15:06.910
and this feature is
input to the model.

330
00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:08.770
The model might
have a parameters

331
00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:11.350
inside or hyper parameters.

332
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:13.975
That means some settings
the user get to choose.

333
00:15:13.975 --> 00:15:16.630
Then after feeding the features

334
00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:20.170
into model the border
will make a prediction.

335
00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:23.395
Initially the model does
not predict very well.

336
00:15:23.395 --> 00:15:25.060
There will be some error between

337
00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.175
the prediction and
target variable.

338
00:15:27.175 --> 00:15:31.090
This adder can be used to
tweak the model to have

339
00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:32.290
a better prediction next

340
00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:34.630
iteration and
over-designed iteration,

341
00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:36.785
the model becomes more accurate.

342
00:15:36.785 --> 00:15:39.840
That's how supervised
learning works.

343
00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:44.460
Here is a brief taxonomy of
unsupervised learning models.

344
00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.310
Models that has
internal parameters,

345
00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:49.505
it is called the
parametric models.

346
00:15:49.505 --> 00:15:52.270
Without explaining what
those are individually,

347
00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:54.925
these are examples of
parametric models,

348
00:15:54.925 --> 00:15:57.100
whereas non-parametric models or

349
00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.960
doesn't have
internal parameters.

350
00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.080
These are examples of
non-parametric models.

351
00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.760
Although we're not going to talk

352
00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.515
about every single model here.

353
00:16:05.515 --> 00:16:09.470
We'll talk about most of
these models in this class.
