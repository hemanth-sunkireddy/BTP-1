Hi, I'm Jaegang Kim from Sunggyunkan University.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
From now on, we'll talk about the basic concept of machine learning.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This is my first time, so I want to talk about just two things.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
One is what is machine learning, and the other is the three types of machine learning.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So, shall we start?

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And this is the whole content of today.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So, I want to first talk about what is machine learning,

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and then I will share about three types of machine learning,

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So, what is machine learning?

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let's first talk about the artificial intelligence.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's the science and engineering of making intelligence machines.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And the machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence,

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
so it's a sort of subset of artificial intelligence.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And deep learning is also famous concept,

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and it's also the subset of machine learning.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Actually, it is based on the neural network,

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
which is one of the machine learning algorithm.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So, I want to talk about what is machine learning.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I can tell you the machine learning is to improve the performance of programs

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
based on given data, previous results, or experiences.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The main difference with the traditional programming is this.
