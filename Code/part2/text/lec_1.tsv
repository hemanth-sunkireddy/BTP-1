0	12000	Hi, I'm Jaegang Kim from Sunggyunkan University.
12000	16000	From now on, we'll talk about the basic concept of machine learning.
16000	21000	This is my first time, so I want to talk about just two things.
21000	28000	One is what is machine learning, and the other is the three types of machine learning.
28000	31000	So, shall we start?
34000	37000	And this is the whole content of today.
37000	42000	So, I want to first talk about what is machine learning,
42000	47000	and then I will share about three types of machine learning,
47000	53000	such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
53000	58000	So, what is machine learning?
58000	62000	Let's first talk about the artificial intelligence.
62000	68000	It's the science and engineering of making intelligence machines.
68000	74000	And the machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence,
74000	78000	so it's a sort of subset of artificial intelligence.
80000	83000	And deep learning is also famous concept,
83000	86000	and it's also the subset of machine learning.
86000	89000	Actually, it is based on the neural network,
89000	93000	which is one of the machine learning algorithm.
93000	99000	So, I want to talk about what is machine learning.
99000	107000	I can tell you the machine learning is to improve the performance of programs
107000	112000	based on given data, previous results, or experiences.
112000	124000	The main difference with the traditional programming is this.
