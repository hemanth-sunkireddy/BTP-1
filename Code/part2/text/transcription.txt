 Hi, I'm Jae-gang Kim from Sunggyung-gan University. From now on, we'll talk about the basic concept of machine learning. This is my first time, so I want to talk about just two things. One is what is machine learning, and the other is the three types of machine learning. So, shall we start? And this is the whole content of today. So, I want to first talk about what is machine learning, and then I will share about three types of machine learning, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. So, what is machine learning? Let's first talk about the artificial intelligence. It's the science and engineering of making intelligence machines. And the machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence, so it's a sort of subset of artificial intelligence. And deep learning is also famous concept, and it's also the subset of machine learning. Actually, it is based on the neural network, which is one of the machine learning algorithm. So, I want to talk about what is machine learning. I can tell you, the machine learning is to improve the performance of programs based on given data, previous results, or experiences. The main difference with the traditional programming is this.
