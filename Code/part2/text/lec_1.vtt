Hi, I'm Jaegang Kim from Sunggyunkan University.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
From now on, we'll talk about the basic concept of machine learning.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
This is my first time, so I want to talk about just two things.

00:21.000 --> 00:28.000
One is what is machine learning, and the other is the three types of machine learning.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
So, shall we start?

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
And this is the whole content of today.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
So, I want to first talk about what is machine learning,

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
and then I will share about three types of machine learning,

00:47.000 --> 00:53.000
such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
So, what is machine learning?

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
Let's first talk about the artificial intelligence.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
It's the science and engineering of making intelligence machines.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
And the machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence,

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
so it's a sort of subset of artificial intelligence.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
And deep learning is also famous concept,

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
and it's also the subset of machine learning.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
Actually, it is based on the neural network,

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
which is one of the machine learning algorithm.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
So, I want to talk about what is machine learning.

01:39.000 --> 01:47.000
I can tell you the machine learning is to improve the performance of programs

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
based on given data, previous results, or experiences.

01:52.000 --> 02:04.000
The main difference with the traditional programming is this.
