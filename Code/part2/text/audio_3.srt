00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,599
 In this lesson, we're going to be talking about finance.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,660
 And one of the most important aspects of finance is interest.

3
00:00:10,419 --> 00:00:15,880
 When I go to a bank or some other lending institution to borrow money, the bank is happy

4
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:20,079
 to give me that money, but then I'm going to be paying the bank for the privilege of

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:20,980
 using their money.

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,399
 And that amount of money that I pay the bank is called interest.

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:30,739
 Likewise, if I put money in a savings account or I purchase a certificate of deposit, the

8
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:34,640
 bank just doesn't put my money in a little box and leave it there until later.

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,659
 They take my money and lend it to someone else.

10
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,140
 So they are using my money.

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,340
 The bank has to pay me for the privilege of using my money.

12
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:50,880
 Now what makes banks profitable is the rate that they charge people to use the bank's

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,240
 money is higher than the rate that they pay people like me to use my money.

14
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,799
 The amount of interest that a person pays or earns is dependent on three things.

15
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,819
 It's dependent on how much money is involved.

16
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:11,739
 It's dependent upon the rate of interest being paid or the rate of interest being charged.

17
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:15,799
 And it's also dependent upon how much time is involved.

18
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,000
 If I have a loan and I want to decrease the amount of interest that I'm going to pay,

19
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,739
 then I'm either going to have to decrease how much money I borrow.

20
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:31,459
 I'm going to have to borrow the money over a shorter period of time, or I'm going to

21
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:34,959
 have to find a lending institution that charges a lower interest rate.

22
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:40,530
 On the other hand, if I want to earn more interest on my investment, I'm going to have

23
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:47,159
 to invest more money, leave the money in the account for a longer period of time, or find

24
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:49,900
 an institution that will pay me a higher interest rate.
