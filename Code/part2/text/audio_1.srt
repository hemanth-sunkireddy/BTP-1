 Hi, I'm Jaekang Kim from Sungkyungan University.

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,039
 From now on, we'll talk about the basic concept of machine learning.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,960
 This is my first time, so I want to talk about just two things.

4
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,820
 One is what is machine learning, and the other is the three types of machine learning.

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,699
 So, shall we start?

6
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:37,079
 And this is the whole content of today.

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:45,100
 So I want to first talk about what is machine learning, and then I will share about three

8
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:52,320
 types of machine learning, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,020
 learning.

10
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,579
 So, what is machine learning?

11
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,280
 Let's first talk about artificial intelligence.

12
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,859
 It's the science and engineering of making intelligence machines.

13
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:16,780
 And machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence, so it's a sort of subset of

14
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,000
 artificial intelligence.

15
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:26,180
 And deep learning is also a famous concept, and it's also the subset of machine learning.

16
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:33,159
 Actually, it is based on the neural network, which is one of the machine learning algorithms.

17
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:39,640
 So, I want to talk about what is machine learning.

18
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:47,980
 I can tell you that machine learning is to improve the performance of programs based

19
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,000
 on given data, previous results, or experiences.

20
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:00,920
 The main difference with the traditional programming is the
